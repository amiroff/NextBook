## Front Matter

YAML front matter can be used to add title, description, part info, tags and update date to your pages. This page includes a front matter like this:

```yaml

```

!> Note: specifying layout is optional By default, all `.md` and `.mdx` files will use `layouts/index.jsx` as layout. You can use this property to use another one and completely change looks and layout of the page.

## HTML Tags

Markdown allows using html tags except scripts. This way you can use modern html5 tags, embed audio and video and everything else not covered by standard markdown.

## Text Manipulation

```text
**This is bold text**

_This is italic text_

**_This is bold italic text_**

~~This is Strikethrough text~~

Superscript: 19^th^

Subscript: H~2~O

This is ==highlighted== text.
```

results in:

**This is bold text**

_This is italic text_

**_This is bold italic text_**

~~This is Strikethrough text~~

Superscript: 19^th^

Subscript: H~2~O

This is ==highlighted== text.

## Horizontal Lines

Both of these work:

```text
---
***
```

results in:

---

---

## Blockquotes

```text
> Here is a blockquote.

> Blockquotes can also be nested...
>
> > ...by using additional greater-than signs right next to each other...
> >
> > > ...or with spaces between arrows.
```

results in:

> Here is a blockquote.

> Blockquotes can also be nested...
>
> > ...by using additional `greater-than` signs right next to each other...
> >
> > > ...or with spaces between arrows.

## Footnotes

```
Footnote 1 link. [^first]

Footnote 2 link. [^second]

[^first]: Footnote **can have markup**.

[^second]: Simple footnote text.
```

results in:

Footnote 1 link. [^first]

Footnote 2 link. [^second]

[^first]: Footnote **can have markup**
[^second]: Footnote text.

## Code

A special care was given to displaying code on screen.

**Inline Code**

```
`$ rm -rf /`
```

results in: `$ rm -rf /`

**Indented Code (4 spaces)**

```
    // Some comments
    line 1 of code
    line 2 of code
    line 3 of code
```

results in:

    // Some comments
    line 1 of code
    line 2 of code
    line 3 of code

** Using Fenced Code Blocks**

Most of the time you'll use codefences. Here is a simple example, but you can do a lot more with them. For advanced fenced code block usages, see [Fenced Code](/documentation/fencedcode) chapter.

````
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello World"
```
````

results in:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello World"
```

## Lists

**Unordered List**

```
- Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
- Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!
```

results in:

- Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
- Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    - Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    * Nulla volutpat aliquam velit

* Very easy!

**Ordered List**

```
1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa

4. You can use sequential numbers...
1. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`
```

results in:

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa

4. You can use sequential numbers...
5. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

**Start Numbering With Offset**

```
57. foo
1. bar
```

results in:

57. foo
1. bar

## Checkboxes

These are often used to indicate task items.

```
**TASK LIST**

- [x] Clone repo
- [x] Create some pages
- [ ] Commit & Push
- [ ] Deploy!
```

results in:

**TASK LIST**

- [x] Clone repo
- [x] Create some pages
- [ ] Commit & Push
- [ ] Deploy!

## Tables

Tables are a bit tricky, because you have to use all those pipes, but this is how markdown was designed. Using a special markdown editor like [Typora](https://typora.io/) will make your life easier with these.

**Standard Columns**

```
| Option | Description                                                 |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------|
| data   | path to data files to supply the data passed into templates.|
| engine | engine to be used for processing templates.                 |
| ext    | extension to be used for dest files.                        |
```

results in:

| Option | Description                                                  |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| data   | path to data files to supply the data passed into templates. |
| engine | engine to be used for processing templates.                  |
| ext    | extension to be used for dest files.                         |

**Right Aligned Columns**

```
| Option | Description                                                   |
| -----: | ------------------------------------------------------------: |
| data   | path to data files to supply the data passed into templates.  |
| engine | engine to be used for processing templates.                   |
| ext    | extension to be used for dest files.                          |
```

results in:

| Option |                                                  Description |
| -----: | -----------------------------------------------------------: |
|   data | path to data files to supply the data passed into templates. |
| engine |                  engine to be used for processing templates. |
|    ext |                         extension to be used for dest files. |

**Mixed Columns**

```
| Left-aligned | Center-aligned | Right-aligned |
| :----------- | :------------: | ------------: |
| git status   | git status     | git status    |
| git diff     | git diff       | git diff      |
```

results in:

| Left-aligned | Center-aligned | Right-aligned |
| :----------- | :------------: | ------------: |
| git status   |   git status   |    git status |
| git diff     |    git diff    |      git diff |

## Images

You will use images a lot! Drop your images or svg vectors in public folder and link to them. NextBook will autoscale them for small displays. You can add captions and `alt` information to your images.

```
![](/images/octocat.png)
![The Surface](/images/surface.jpg 'The Surface Device')
![Git Branching](/images/branching.svg 'Excalidraw FTW')
```

results in:

![](/images/octocat.png) ![The Surface](/images/surface.jpg 'The Surface Device')

If you use [Excalidraw]() svg drawings and want them to change colors accordingly in dark mode, add `|ex` to image alt text. See below example in light/dark modes:

```
![Git Branching|ex](/images/git-branching.svg)
```

results in:

![Git Branching|ex](/images/git-branching.svg)

## Links

Links can be auto-detected, but it would be better to be implicit and have support other markdown tools. Also, all external links in your documentation will be autodetected and appropriate html code will be generated.

```
- [Basic link](https://github.com)

- [Link with title](https://github.com 'Github FTW')

- Link with angle brackets: <https://github.com/remarkjs>

- Autoconverted link https://github.com/remarkjs

- Cross page [absolute link](/documentation/getting-started) for single page app navigation.

- Link to [part of a page](#links)

- Linking with image:

- [![Deploy with Vercel raw][1]][2]

[1]:  https://vercel.com/button
[2]:  https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Famiroff%2FNextBook "Deploy With Vercel now!"

```

results in:

- [Basic link](https://github.com)

- [Link with title](https://github.com 'Github FTW')

- Link with angle brackets: <https://github.com/remarkjs>

- Autoconverted link https://github.com/remarkjs

- Cross page [absolute link](/documentation/getting-started) for single page app navigation.

- Link to [part of a page](#links)

- Linking with image: [![Deploy with Vercel raw][1]][2]

[1]: https://vercel.com/button
[2]: https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Famiroff%2FNextBook 'Deploy With Vercel now!'

## Notifications

These are custom features often needed to display hints. I find them very useful.

### Hints

```
!> A Hint Title
Make sure to check out [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to check the basic markdown syntax you can use with NextBook.
```

results in:

!> A Hint Title Make sure to check out [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to check the basic markdown syntax you can use with NextBook.

### Warnings

```
?> And Warning Title
Try to keep usage of html elements to rare cases where standard markdown does not cover your basic markup needs.
```

results in:

?> And Warning Title Try to keep usage of html elements to rare cases where standard markdown does not cover your basic markup needs.

### Errors

```
x> An Error Title
Ooooops, an unknown error occured.
```

results in:

x> An Error Title Ooooops, an unknown error occured.

## Emojis

Nothing fancy, just use typical 🥳 emojis. Press <kbd>control + command + space</kbd> on macOS and <kbd>windows + .</kbd> on Windows.

## Containers

Containers begin with `::: [noparse] {HTML Element Name} [optional list of classes]` on a new line, and end with `:::` on a new line. Container markers may be indented by up to 2 spaces and be nested.

```markdown
::: aside class-one class-two

# Header One

With container contents. :::
```

will result in:

```html
<aside class="class-one class-two">
  <h1>Header One</h1>
  <p>With container contents.</p>
</aside>
```

Use this for custom UI elements. Some examples:

### Badges

See [reference](https://www.gethalfmoon.com/docs/badges/) for all available classes.

```markdown
::: badge badge-primary badge-pill BASICS :::
```

results in:

::: badge badge-primary badge-pill BASICS :::

### Cards

See [reference](https://www.gethalfmoon.com/docs/content-and-cards/) for all available classes.

```markdown
::: card w-400 The weather forecast didn't say that, but the steel plate in his hip did. He had learned over the years to trust his hip over the weatherman. It was going to rain, so he better get outside and prepare... :::
```

results in:

::: card w-400 The weather forecast didn't say that, but the steel plate in his hip did. He had learned over the years to trust his hip over the weatherman. It was going to rain, so he better get outside and prepare... :::

### Accordion

```markdown
::: details ::: summary Toggle Me ::: ...and see my content :::
```

results in:

::: details ::: summary Toggle Me ::: ...and see my content :::

### Tabs

While [markdown spec](https://commonmark.org) does not offer any tabbed interface, NextBook has you covered here. Use `tabs` and `tab` containers as follows:

```markdown
::: tabs ::: tab Windows Directions

Install via [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org):

`choco install python` ::: ::: tab macOS Directions

Install via [brew](https://brew.sh):

`brew install python3` :::

::: tab Linux Directions

Install via apt:

`sudo apt install python3` ::: :::
```

results in:

::: tabs ::: tab Windows Directions

Install via [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org):

`choco install python` ::: ::: tab macOS Directions

Install via [brew](https://brew.sh):

`brew install python3` :::

::: tab Linux Directions

Install via apt:

`sudo apt install python3` ::: :::

## Fenced Code

Oftentimes, you need to display a code example on the page. This example could be as simple as a one-liner or as complex as a diff view. Below are the ways you can use fenced code blocks with NextBook.

## Simple Fenced Block

Wrap your code using triple \``` characters for the simplest code formatting.

````
```
Everything within fenced code will
be displayed in monospace font.
```
````

results in:

```
Everything within fenced code will
be displayed in monospace font.
```

## Syntax Highlighting

### Theme-Aware Highlighting

You can add syntax highlighting by specifying code's [language](https://prismjs.com/index.html#supported-languages) after triple ```. NextBook uses [PrismJS](https://github.com/PrismJS) for themes and language definitions as it is currently the most complete one.

When application's theme changes, so does the fenced code theme. Try it now by pressing <kbd>T</kbd>.

````
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'

function Square(props) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(null)

  return (
    <button className="square" onClick={() => alert('click')}>
      {props.value}
    </button>
  )
}
```
````

results in:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'

function Square(props) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(null)

  return (
    <button className='square' onClick={() => alert('click')}>
      {props.value}
    </button>
  )
}
```

### Forced Dark Theme

You can force dark syntax highlighting even on light theme. Provide `dark` parameter to do that. Swith to light theme by pressing <kbd>T</kbd>. to see code block below still using dark theme.

````
```jsx dark
import React, { useState } from 'react'

function Square(props) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(null)

  return (
    <button className="square" onClick={() => alert('click')}>
      {props.value}
    </button>
  )
}
```
````

results in:

```jsx dark
import React, { useState } from 'react'

function Square(props) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(null)

  return (
    <button className='square' onClick={() => alert('click')}>
      {props.value}
    </button>
  )
}
```

## Clipboard Button

Any code block will have automatic `Copy` icon clicking which copies contents of code block to clipboard.

## Code Header Information

You can display various information like title and link to source in code header.

### Code Title

Often you need to tell which file you are talking about. You can specify this by adding `title` info:

````
```jsx title=app.jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'

function Square(props) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(null)

  return (
    <button className="square" onClick={() => alert('click')}>
      {props.value}
    </button>
  )
}
```
````

results in:

```jsx title=app.jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'

function Square(props) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(null)

  return (
    <button className='square' onClick={() => alert('click')}>
      {props.value}
    </button>
  )
}
```

### Linked Code Title

In case you need to link to original source you can pass `link` metadata. Now, title will be a link to the specified URL.

````
```python title=Colors/primary_colors.py link=https://github.com/geekcomputers/Python/blob/master/Colors/primary_colors.py
def diff(a, b):
    """
    TODO: fix this function!!
    """
    return a - b
```
````

results in:

```python title=Colors/primary_colors.py link=https://github.com/geekcomputers/Python/blob/master/Colors/primary_colors.py
def diff(a, b):
    """
    TODO: fix this function!!
    """
    return a - b
```

## Line Numbering

### Automatic Numbering

Lines of code can have automatic numbering. Provide `numbered` metadata to achive that:

````
```html numbered
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang='en'>
<head>
    <meta charset='UTF-8'>
    <meta http-equiv='X-UA-Compatible' content='IE=edge'>
    <meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0'>
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
````

results in:

```html numbered
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Numbering With Manual Offset

Code can start from any provided number. Use `numbered` together with `startline` metadata to achive that. Default startline is `1` unless provided.

````
```html numbered startline=3
<head>
    <meta charset='UTF-8'>
    <meta http-equiv='X-UA-Compatible' content='IE=edge'>
    <meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0'>
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
```
````

results in:

```html numbered startline=3
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <title>Document</title>
</head>
```

## Line Marking

In some cases there's a need to highlight/mark some lines and then describe each line seperately. Any number of lines can be marked by providing `marked` parameter:

````
```html marked=2,5,6,10
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang='en'>
<head>
    <meta charset='UTF-8'>
    <meta http-equiv='X-UA-Compatible' content='IE=edge'>
    <meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0'>
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
````

results in:

```html marked=2,5,6,10
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Line Diffing

Sometimes you want to show which lines were added or removed from code. This can be achieved by passing related line numbers as `added` and `removed` parameters. Added lines will be highlighted with light green, removed lines with light red color. Note that displaying numbers, although works, in this case would cause a confusion as line numbers do not repeat.

````
```html removed=2,8 added=3,9,10
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang='en'>
<html lang='ja'>
<head>
...
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <h1>こんにちは世界!</h1>
    <p>今日は天気がいいですね。</p>
</body>
</html>
```
````

results in:

```html removed=2,8 added=3,9,10
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <html lang="ja">
    <head>
      ...
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
      <h1>こんにちは世界!</h1>
      <p>今日は天気がいいですね。</p>
    </body>
  </html>
</html>
```

You can also pass every other parameter mentioned above together. Here we are adding some of them:

````
```html numbered marked=2,5,6,10 title=public/index.html link=https://gist.github.com/amiroff/04d57ef025845b191d9cd30c7ca13f20
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang='en'>
<head>
    <meta charset='UTF-8'>
    <meta http-equiv='X-UA-Compatible' content='IE=edge'>
    <meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0'>
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
````

results in

```html numbered marked=2,5,6,10 title=public/index.html link=https://gist.github.com/amiroff/04d57ef025845b191d9cd30c7ca13f20
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Including External Code File

Sometimes code to display is so big that it's inconvenient to embed it in markdown document. For cases like this, including original file with `file` is possible. Provided path should be relative to current document.

````
```json file=../public/manifest.json
```
````

results in:

```json file=../../../public/manifest.json

```

## Escaping Code Blocks

To escape (prevent from displaying as highlighted code) block and simply display how fenced code is being used in source, wrap it with `~~~`:

````
~~~
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang='en'>
<head>
    <meta charset='UTF-8'>
    <meta http-equiv='X-UA-Compatible' content='IE=edge'>
    <meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0'>
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
```
~~~
````

will result in:

````
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang='en'>
<head>
    <meta charset='UTF-8'>
    <meta http-equiv='X-UA-Compatible' content='IE=edge'>
    <meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0'>
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
```
````
