# Development 101

My name is Lacy Morrow, and I'll be your guide through the wonderful world of coding!

At AAM institute, we believe there’s a better, faster way to become a top notch coder that doesn’t exist right now.

**It’s a fact - the most effective way to become a competent, hireable programmer is by building real world applications and having hands-on support from experts.**

---

### **AAM stands for (A)gile (A)cademic (M)ethod.**

It’s a process we’ve created that teaches coding through the simulation of a real-world product team. Developers with years of experience will tell you, no one really knows what it’s like to be an engineer until you get your first job.

**We want to get you ahead.** When you graduate from our program, **you’ll have real product team experience** working in a development shop that other graduates from other programs won’t have. That’s going to help you **land a job** and perform better than all the other new hires, meaning more salary and job growth, _**faster**_

So many college classes and bootcamps are based around cookie-cutter projects. You and your fellow students do the exact same coding assignments and when you graduate, you all compete for the same jobs with the exact same portfolio.

**We want to make you stand out from everyone else.** You’ll graduate with a one-of-a-kind portfolio, filled to the brim with a **variety** of different applications.

#### So how do we get started?

Enter Development 101, our precursor to our full AAM program. This crash course will give you the foundational knowledge needed for you to be functional during our AAM pilot.

This course **is not meant to make you a job-ready coder.** It’s just the basics to get you up to speed. We’ve developed it to be as short as possible, because we know the real learning and development happens during AAM.

#### But what do you mean by “Pilot”?

AAM institute is **not currently live**. We’re doing a bunch of tests right now to create our final approach and guess what? You’re one of our lucky guinea pigs.

We've put hours and hours into research to find the online sources and tools that we believe are the best, and we’ve combined them into this introductory course.

We believe the process we’ve put together with these materials is the fastest and most fun way to get up to speed with coding basics.

**This course is free for you because it’s a test. We are only opening it to a very small amount of people.** Can you help us out by letting me know how your experience goes, what questions you have and where you struggled most?

**I’ll be with you every step of the way to help.**

#### What happens when I complete Dev101

Once you complete the free pilot for Dev101, **you’ll be eligible to join our AAM Pilot Program for free as well!**

Spots are **EXTREMELY limited** in the AAM Pilot Program and will only be available for **a very short time**. We will be accepting only those that finish Dev101 first and have the best test results.

So if you want to join our AAM Pilot Program for **free** (a \~$2,500 value), work hard on Dev101, finish it quickly, but make sure you learn the material and do well on the projects/tests!

### Warning: Do not skip anything!

We have built this course very carefully, so **please do not skip anything!** I repeat, **do not skip anything!** We spent so much time cutting this down to the most important information only, so every step is essential.

Good luck and thanks for joining the AAM community! We can’t wait to work with you.
