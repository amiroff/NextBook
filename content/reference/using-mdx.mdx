## What Is MDX?

MDX to markdown is the same as JSX to JS. To quote the [original site](https://mdxjs.com/),

> MDX is an authorable format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content. This makes writing long-form content with components a blast ðŸš€.

... and this one:

> Writing is fun again when you combine components, that can even be dynamic or load data, with the simplicity of Markdown for long-form content.

Basically, renaming your `.md` file to `.mdx` gives you ability to import and use React components as if it was a normal React or Next.js app.

Here is a small demo video for curious:

<iframe
  width='100%'
  height='400'
  src='https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d2sQiI5NFAM'
  frameBorder='0'
  allow='accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture'
  allowFullScreen
></iframe>

## Using Custom Components

Say we have a basic React counter component like this:

```jsx title=components/example-counter.jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div className='border border-gray-500 p-2 m-10 rounded-md bg-gray-700 text-gray-100'>
      <p>You clicked {count} times!</p>
      <button
        onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}
        className='rounded border border-gray-500 bg-gray-900 p-1 mt-2'
      >
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

If you need to use components in your markdown content files, use `.mdx` extension, and provide any custom components through the `components/component-mapper.jsx` file. Then include it in your `.mdx` file and display it just like in React application:

```markdown
### Example Counter Component

<Counter />
```

becomes:

### Example Counter Component

<Counter />

Voila! This way you can create dynamic components for your documentation like never before. Live code editors, quizes, exams, cheatsheets, comments, you name it. Possibilities are endless. Notice that you can use tailwindcss classnames in components for styling.

## MDX-Embed

You can also use any components from [MDX-Embed](https://mdx-embed.com/) to embed content from other sites like YouTube, Twitter, Codepen, etc. For example, to embed a YouTube video, you can use the following syntax:

```markdown
<YouTube youTubeId='dQw4w9WgXcQ' />
```

becomes:

<YouTube youTubeId='dQw4w9WgXcQ' />
