# 1.0 Initial Setup

### 1.1 Operating System

<mark>**Read**</mark>[ this awesome article here](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/computerbasics/understanding-operating-systems/1/) to learn about Operating Systems.

### 1.2 Browsers

There are many browsers available for various desktop and mobile platforms, the one we will be using is [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Some website features may work differently or not at all depending on the user's OS, browser, and versions. Therefore this course will assume you are using the latest version of Chrome.

We suggest using Chrome as your browser. Just like Chrome, Apple's Safari and Microsoft's Edge browsers are built on top of Google's Webkit engine, so they may work perfectly fine. In our opinion, however, Chrome is the leading browser at this time.

### 1.1 Windows Prerequisites (install Ubuntu Linux)

**If you are using a Mac/Ubuntu/Linux, you can skip this section.**

Windows is NOT a UNIX OS, that means that the command prompt in Windows is totally different than Linux or Mac terminal/command-line.

There are some differences in command prompt, bash, and powershell you'll want to be aware of. <mark>**Watch**</mark> [this video here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nahtw_csB5w)

#### Virtual Machine Setup

Window users only: To better serve you during AAM, let's get you set up on a Virtual Machine. A VM is a completely separate, isolated OS running (or emulated) inside of your normal OS. It allows you to install and run programs in a protected sandbox, without having any effect on your current programs and data.

The Odin Project walks through setup of a UNIX OS in a virtual machine. **Windows users will need to follow these instructions**

- Read [this page here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-installation-overview) first, then [this one here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-installations).

## Command-Line Interface (CLI)

A terminal (or command-prompt) is a program for text input and output. It acts as a wrapper and allows us to enter commands that the computer processes. In plain English again, it's the "window" in which you enter the actual commands your computer will process. As developers we will make extensive use of the command-line so it's best to play around and get comfortable with some commands on your own.

Some helpful commands: |---|---|

|`mkdir <directory>`| **M**a**k**e **Dir**ectory. Create a new folder/directory on your system |

|`touch <file>`| Creates an empty file |

## 1.3 Version Control - Git (AKA a time machine for your files)

**Installing Git**

> On Mac, open a terminal and type `git` to initiate an xcode install prompt that will automatically install git.

Reference [this link here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) while you watch [this video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-SKiqoHBnY) (7 min).

**Intro to Git**

Let's get you setup with Git! Follow [this course here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-git-basics) from The Odin Project to get your account set up.\
**At this point you should be able to open a terminal and check your git version by running the following command: \`git -v\`**

## 1.4 Interactive Development Environment (IDE): Visual Studio Code

Now let's get you VSCode. Watch [this video here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics) and follow along. You can [grab VSCode here](https://vscode.dev/).

## 1.5 NodeJS

We're going to be using Javascript on the command-line, outside of the browser. For that, we'll need NodeJS. The Odin Project can help us install it, [follow along with this article here.](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-installing-node-js)

## 1.6 Welcome to Web Dev

Let's go over the tools we've just installed, and get acquainted with Git. [Watch this video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfTXHrWMGVY) (5 min).

### 1.6 PROJECT

Use the command-line, Git, and VSCode to update a repository.

- Create a personal Github account
- Fork [our example project](https://github.com/AAM-Institute/project-001) into your personal account.
- Update the project by adding your name or nickname to the list under "I Was Here"
- Commit to save your changes, then push to your new fork.
- Create a Pull Request back to the original repository. Once it is accepted and merged, your name will be shown on the AAM project page.

This can be done using the Github UI. Bonus points for using the command-line and VSCode!

**Bonus:** Clone your fork to your local machine. Edit the files in VSCode then use the CLI to `git commit` and `git push`. Then create a Pull Request using the Github UI as normal.
