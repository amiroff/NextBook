# 4.0 Javascript Basics

Now let's jump into Javascript, the programming language of The Web. These next videos give a great intro to adding Javascript to a page and doing basic scripts:

This gives a pretty basic intro to adding Javascript to a page and doing basic scripts:

### 4.1 Javascript in HTML

The Odin Project once again has some wonderful JS guides we will use for now

- [Fundamentals: part 1](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-fundamentals-part-1)
- [Fundamentals: part 2](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-fundamentals-part-2)
- [Fundamentals: part 3](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-fundamentals-part-3)

Let's see it in action! [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeFzkC2awTM) demonstrates creating a dynamic shopping cart using Vanilla JS. (45 min)

### 4.2 Developer tools (inspecting JS):

The developer tools can do more than edit HTML and styles, it contains a full-fledged console! [The Odin Project has more to say](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-javascript-developer-tools).

### 4.3 JS in-depth

There's a lot more to Javascript and a Web Developer vs a Web Designer. DOM manipulation is how we interact with the HTML page, and Events are how we know that things have changed (e.g. user interacted with the page). Learn about [DOM manipulation & events](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-dom-manipulation-and-events).

[Errors](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-understanding-errors) aren't usually fun to deal with as developers, but through defensive programming and a thorough understanding of how errors are handled, we can make debugging much more pleasant.

[Forms](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-form-basics) are normally how we receive input from a user. [Form Validation](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-form-validation) is necessary to ensure that any user input is safe and [sanitary](https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/input-sanitization/).

### 4.4 NodeJS

Normally, Javascript only runs within a browser. NodeJS is a runtime that allows Javascript to be run anywhere, including as a back-end language on the server.

### 4.5 Project: Javascript

Let's add some interactivity to our custom webpage using Javascript. Add an image to your page from [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com), then create a refresh button to load a new image.

> [Live Demo](https://project-004--lacymorrow.repl.co/)

- Create a way to dynamically load a new image onto your page
- Commit your changes to Git.
- Deploy your page to Github Pages

**Bonus:** Create a light and dark mode for your page!
