## What Is NextBook?

NextBook is quick and easy way to buid technical books or documentation that support modern standards and run blazingly fast. It's built with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) and works by compiling markdown or MDX down to plain static html. This way, first content render on user's device is very fast, then hydration kicks in and React takes over to add dynamic stuff. The possibilities are endless.

## Primary Features

Main reasons to try **NextBook** on your next documentation project are:

- Great out of the box UI with [HalfMoon](https://www.gethalfmoon.com/)
- Good enough functionality and blazing speed with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- Easy content creation (plain [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)) and collaboration ([Git](https://github.com/))
- You own your data
- Fast to get started, just clone the repo and modify to your liking.
- One click (or push) [deployment](https://vercel.com/new)
- Unlimited dynamic features can be added with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)
