# NextBook: Create lovely documentation with MDX!

## What Is NextBook?

**Try live example [here](https://next-book.vercel.app)**

NextBook is quick and easy way to buid technical books or documentation that support modern standards and run blazingly fast. It's built with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) and works by compiling markdown or MDX down to plain static html. This way, first content render on user's device is very fast, then hydration kicks in and React takes over to add dynamic stuff. The possibilities are endless.

## Primary Features

### User Interface

- Fast and responsive UI, content should be readable and accessible on most devices.
- Good out of the box looks thanks to [Halfmoon](https://www.gethalfmoon.com/).
- Keyboard shortcuts to toggle features (sidebar, lights off, next/previous page navigation).
- Built-in light and dark mode (press <kbd>shift + R</kbd>) for pleasant reading.
- Smooth progressbar on top indicating how far on the page you are.
- Side menu that keeps reader's read progress.
- In-page dynamic table of contents (if titles are used within the document) with scroolspy.

### SEO

- SEO optimised meta tags.
- robots.txt generated at build time.
- Sitemap generated at built time.
