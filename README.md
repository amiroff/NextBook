**[NextBook](https://next-book.vercel.app)** is quick and easy way to buid technical books or documentation that support modern standards and run blazingly fast. It works by compiling markdown and MDX to static pages. This way, first content render on user's device is near instant.

[NextBook](https://next-book.vercel.app) makes writing technical docs stupid simple while keeping featureset minimal but open for further extension.

- Navigation bar.
- Updated dependencies.
- Refined mobile UI.
- Less code (−4,000 LOC).

## Getting Started

1. Having Node installed beforehand, bootstrap a new project with `npx create-next-app my-awesome-book -e https://github.com/amiroff/NextBook`
2. Run `npm run dev:watch` and open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
3. Check documentation to see what's possible with NextBook.
4. Create your [markdown](/reference/markdown) or [MDX](/reference/using-mdx) content in `content` folder. Pages should auto-refresh as you modify markdown content.
5. Update `config/config.json` with your table of contents and other information.
6. Update `pages/index.jsx` to suit your needs as a standalone landing page or as a redirect to content.
7. [Deploy](https://vercel.com/new) your respository or export (`npm run export`) and copy your content to any static hosting provider like Vercel, Netlify, Github Pages or Google Cloud.
8. Have fun! 🎉

This should be enough to have a statically generated documentation page/book.
